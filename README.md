# Overview

Example test project for using cheap-and-cheerful fingerprint reader modules with STM32 cores - uses the MIT-licensed 'FPM-C' library, included under 'lib/'.

Currently only tested with the STM32F103C8 'Blue Pill' and STM32L432KC 'Nucleo' boards.

The core library functions seem to work, but it's a pretty messy example.
